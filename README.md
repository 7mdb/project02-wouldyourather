# Would You Rather Project

This is a completed project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter), for this course contains `_DATA.js` file that represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the `_DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, which I have provided on this final project.

## Installation

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

I have used the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.
